# Module 5 - Transform the Sample Application to .NET Core

**Time to complete:** 10 minutes

### Overview

In this module, we introduce a fix for the observed .NET Core compatibility issues.  But first, let's experiment with tooling that will provide us with useful compatibility insights not only on this sample project but with much more complex migration scenarios.

## Configure the .NET Portability Analyzer

1. Recall that you previously installed the *.NET Portability Analyzer* Visual Studio extension during module 3.  Now, let's configure this extension to investigate our solution for code that would be inconpatible with various *.NET Core* target versions.  

2. Right-click the *VlanMigrate* project name within the Solution Explorer.  Then select the **Portability Analyzer Settings** menu option.
