# Module 6 - Dockerize the Sample Application


**Time to complete:** 10 minutes

**Services used:**


### Overview

In this module, we will add Docker support to our app and containerize it. 

If you are new to Docker or using Docker with .NET, it is recommended to read [this first](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/docker/intro-net-docker) to give you a quick overview of Docker basics. You can skip the Azure section. :-)

Firstly, install [Visual Studio Tools for Docker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/containerized-lifecycle-architecture/design-develop-containerized-apps/visual-studio-tools-for-docker) which will allow you to access Docker tooling from within Visual Studio.

Visual Studio should have created a Dockerfile for you. The next step is to run the application in a container, following [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/docker/build-container#create-a-container).
