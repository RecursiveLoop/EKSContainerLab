### Overview

In this module, we will add Docker support to our app and containerize it. 


Firstly, install [Visual Studio Tools for Docker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/containerized-lifecycle-architecture/design-develop-containerized-apps/visual-studio-tools-for-docker) which will allow you to access Docker tooling from within Visual Studio.
