### Overview

In this module, we will download our sample application project files, demo the solution, and begin the process of migrating to .NET Core from .NET Framework.

Let's begin with a discussion of the project. Our sample is derived from a real-world enterprise project in which a Data-Center Network Operations team sought to replace a legacy Juniper routing infrastructure with new Cisco routers.  Of course, replacing a network fabric requires a great deal of planning and concise step-wise execution.  A key concern was how to move and transform hundreds of Virtual LAN (VLAN) configurations from Juniper to Cisco script format.  Ultimately, the network team asked for a custom application that would take as input Juniper VLAN configuration statements and transform those into new Cisco VLAN configuration statements, accounting for transformation rules and for router redundancy considerations. The resultant auto-generated VLAN scripts could then be merged with full-device configuration scripts and thus accomplish a reliable, repeatable, router configuration. 

The following image illustrates this specific enterprise problem-solution scenario.
